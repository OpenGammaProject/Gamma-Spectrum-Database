<sup>59</sup>Co is the only stable cobalt isotope and the only isotope that exists naturally on Earth. Twenty-two radioisotopes have been characterized: the most stable, <sup>60</sup>Co, has a half-life of 5.2714 years; <sup>57</sup>Co has a half-life of 271.8 days; <sup>56</sup>Co has a half-life of 77.27 days; and <sup>58</sup>Co has a half-life of 70.86 days. All the other radioactive isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than 18 hours, and in most cases shorter than 1 second.

Cobalt-57 is used as a source in MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy of iron-containing samples. Electron capture by <sup>57</sup>Co forms an excited state of the <sup>57</sup>Fe nucleus, which in turn decays to the ground state with emission of a gamma ray. Measurement of the gamma ray spectrum provides information about the chemical state of the iron atom in the sample. 

Cobalt-57 is also used in medical tests; it is used as a radiolabel for vitamin B12 uptake.
