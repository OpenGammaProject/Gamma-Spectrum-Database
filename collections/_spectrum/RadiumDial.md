Radium dials are watch, clock and other instrument dials painted with luminous paint containing radium-226 to produce radioluminescence. Radium dials were produced throughout most of the 20th century before being replaced by safer tritium-based luminous material in the 1970s and finally by non-toxic, non-radioactive strontium aluminateâ€“based photoluminescent material from the middle 1990s.

Due to the use of <sup>226</sup>Ra only, without adding any other radioisotope, this spectrum is (almost) completely identical to the other <sup>226</sup>Ra measurement in this database.
