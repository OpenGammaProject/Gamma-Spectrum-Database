Potassium-40 (<sup>40</sup>K) is a radioactive isotope of potassium which has a long half-life of 1.25 billion years. It makes up about 0.012% (120 ppm) of the total amount of potassium found in nature.

Potassium-40 is a rare example of a nuclide that undergoes both types of beta decay. In about 89.28% of events, it decays to calcium-40 (<sup>40</sup>Ca) with emission of a beta particle (β−, an electron) with a maximum energy of 1.31 MeV and an antineutrino. In about 10.72% of events, it decays to argon-40 (<sup>40</sup>r) by electron capture (EC), with the emission of a neutrino and then a 1.460 MeV gamma ray. The radioactive decay of this particular isotope explains the large abundance of argon (nearly 1%) in the Earth's atmosphere, as well as prevalence of <sup>40</sup>Ar over other isotopes. Very rarely (0.001% of events), it decays to <sup>40</sup>Ar by emitting a positron (β+) and a neutrino.
