The longest-lived radioisotopes of lead (<sub>82</sub>Pb) are <sup>205</sup>Pb with a half-life of 17.3 million years and <sup>202</sup>Pb with a half-life of 52,500 years. A shorter-lived naturally occurring radioisotope, <sup>210</sup>Pb with a half-life of 22.2 years, is useful for studying the sedimentation chronology of environmental samples on time scales shorter than 100 years.
