Naturally occurring europium (<sub>63</sub>Eu) is composed of 2 isotopes, <sup>151</sup>Eu and <sup>153</sup>Eu, with <sup>153</sup>Eu being the most abundant (52.2% natural abundance). While <sup>153</sup>Eu is observationally stable, <sup>151</sup>Eu was found in 2007 to be unstable and undergo alpha decay.

Besides the natural radioisotope <sup>151</sup>Eu, 36 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable being <sup>150</sup>Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, <sup>152</sup>Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, <sup>154</sup>Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years, and <sup>155</sup>Eu with a half-life of 4.7612 years. The majority of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 12.2 seconds.
