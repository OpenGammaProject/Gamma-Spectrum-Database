Sodium has two radioactive cosmogenic isotopes (<sup>22</sup>Na, with a half-life of 2.6019(6) years; and <sup>24</sup>Na, with a half-life of 14.9560(15) h). With the exception of those two isotopes, all other isotopes have half-lives under a minute, most under a second. The shortest-lived is <sup>18</sup>Na, with a half-life of 1.3(4)Ã—10<sup>-21</sup> seconds.

Sodium-22 is a radioactive isotope of sodium, undergoing positron emission to <sup>22</sup>Ne with a half-life of 2.6019(6) years. <sup>22</sup>Na is being investigated as an efficient generator of "cold positrons" (antimatter) to produce muons for catalyzing fusion of deuterium. It is also commonly used as a positron source in positron annihilation spectroscopy.

<sup>22</sup>Na is a positron-emitting isotope with a remarkably long half-life. It is used to create test-objects and point-sources for positron emission tomography.
