Naturally occurring chromium (<sub>24</sub>Cr) is composed of four stable isotopes; <sup>50</sup>Cr, <sup>52</sup>Cr, <sup>53</sup>Cr, and <sup>54</sup>Cr with <sup>52</sup>Cr being the most abundant (83.789% natural abundance). <sup>50</sup>Cr is suspected of decaying by β<sup>+</sup>β<sup>+</sup> to <sup>50</sup>Ti with a half-life of (more than) 1.8×10<sup>17</sup> years. Twenty-two radioisotopes, all of which are entirely synthetic, have been characterized with the most stable being <sup>51</sup>Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours.

Chromium-51 is a manmade isotope of chromium used in medicine as a radioisotopic tracer.
