Iron-55 (<sup>55</sup>Fe) is a radioactive isotope of iron with a nucleus containing 26 protons and 29 neutrons. It decays by electron capture to <sup>55</sup>Mn and this process has a half-life of 2.737 years. The emitted X-rays can be used as an X-ray source for various scientific analysis methods, such as X-ray diffraction. <sup>55</sup>Fe is also a source for Auger electrons, which are produced during the decay.

The K-alpha X-rays emitted by the <sup>55</sup>Mn after the electron capture have been used as a laboratory source of X-rays in various X-ray scattering techniques. The advantages of the emitted X-rays are that they are monochromatic and are continuously produced over a years-long period. No electrical power is needed for this emission, which is ideal for portable X-ray instruments, such as X-ray fluorescence instruments.
