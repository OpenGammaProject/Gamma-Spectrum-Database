<sup>59</sup>Co is the only stable cobalt isotope and the only isotope that exists naturally on Earth. Twenty-two radioisotopes have been characterized: the most stable, <sup>60</sup>Co, has a half-life of 5.2714 years; <sup>57</sup>Co has a half-life of 271.8 days; <sup>56</sup>Co has a half-life of 77.27 days; and <sup>58</sup>Co has a half-life of 70.86 days. All the other radioactive isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than 18 hours, and in most cases shorter than 1 second.

Cobalt-60 is used in radiotherapy. It produces two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV. The <sup>60</sup>Co source is useful for about 5 years but even after this point is still very radioactive, and so cobalt machines have fallen from favor in the Western world where linacs are common.

Cobalt-60 is useful as a gamma ray source because it can be produced in predictable quantities, and for its high radioactivity simply by exposing natural cobalt to neutrons in a reactor. The uses for industrial cobalt include:

- Sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste
- Radiation treatment of foods for sterilization (cold pasteurization)
- Industrial radiography (e.g., weld integrity radiographs)
- Density measurements (e.g., concrete density measurements)
- Tank fill height switches.
