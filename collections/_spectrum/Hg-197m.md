There are seven stable isotopes of mercury, with <sup>202</sup>Hg being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived radioisotopes are <sup>194</sup>Hg with a half-life of 444 years, and <sup>203</sup>Hg with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than a day.

For the synthesis of precious metals two stable mercury isotopes are of potential interest - the trace isotope <sup>196</sup>Hg and the more abundant <sup>198</sup>Hg. Both are "one neutron removed" from <sup>197</sup>Hg, a radioisotope which decays to <sup>197</sup>Au, the only known stable isotope of gold.
