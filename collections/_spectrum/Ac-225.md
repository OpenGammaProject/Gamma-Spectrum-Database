Actinium-225 (<sup>225</sup>Ac, Ac-225) is an isotope of actinium. It undergoes alpha decay to francium-221 with a half-life of 10 days, and is an intermediate decay product in the neptunium series (the decay chain starting at <sup>237</sup>Np). Except for minuscule quantities arising from this decay chain in nature, <sup>225</sup>Ac is entirely synthetic.

The decay properties of actinium-225 are favorable for usage in targeted alpha therapy (TAT); clinical trials have demonstrated the applicability of radiopharmaceuticals containing <sup>225</sup>Ac to treat various types of cancer. However, the scarcity of this isotope resulting from its necessary synthesis in cyclotrons limits its potential applications.
