Although bismuth-209 is now known to be radioactive, it has classically been considered to be a stable isotope because it has a half-life of approximately 2.01×1019 years, which is more than a billion times the age of the universe. Besides <sup>209</sup>Bi, the most stable bismuth radioisotopes are <sup>210m</sup>Bi with a half-life of 3.04 million years, <sup>208</sup>Bi with a half-life of 368,000 years and <sup>207</sup>Bi, with a half-life of 32.9 years, none of which occurs in nature.

Samples of lichen, moss, soil and air collected since 1961 in Greenland, Svalbard, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Sweden and Denmark have been remeasured for γ-emitting radionuclides by Ge(Li) spectroscopy. The samples have shown the presence of <sup>207</sup>Bi (physical half-life 38 years), a nuclide which has not been reported earlier in world-wide fallout. The concentrations of <sup>207</sup>Bi have been compared with those of <sup>60</sup>Co, <sup>125</sup>Sb, and <sup>137</sup>Cs. From this comparison the production of <sup>207</sup>Bi is estimated at 1 PBq. It is assumed that the <sup>207</sup>Bi is created in thermonuclear tested explosions in general and that in particular the 55Mt detonation of 30 October 1961 at Novaya Zemlya may have produced this activation product.
