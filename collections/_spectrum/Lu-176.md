Naturally occurring lutetium (<sub>71</sub>Lu) is composed of one stable isotope <sup>175</sup>Lu (97.41% natural abundance) and one long-lived radioisotope, <sup>176</sup>Lu with a half-life of 3.78 Ã— 10<sup>10</sup> years (2.59% natural abundance). Thirty-five radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most stable, besides <sup>176</sup>Lu, being <sup>174</sup>Lu with a half-life of 3.31 years, and <sup>173</sup>Lu with a half-life of 1.37 years. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 9 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than half an hour. This element also has 18 meta states, with the most stable being <sup>177m</sup>Lu (t<sub>1/2</sub> 160.4 days), <sup>174m</sup>Lu (t<sub>1/2</sub> 142 days) and <sup>178m</sup>Lu (t<sub>1/2</sub> 23.1 minutes).
