Technetium-99m is the hallmark technetium isotope employed in the nuclear medicine industry. Its low-energy isomeric transition, which yields a gamma-ray at ~140.5 keV, is ideal for imaging using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Several technetium isotopes, such as <sup>94m</sup>Tc, <sup>95g</sup>Tc, and <sup>96g</sup>Tc, which are produced via (p,n) reactions using a cyclotron on molybdenum targets, have also been identified as potential Positron Emission Tomography (PET) agents. Technetium-101 has been produced using a D-D fusion-based neutron generator from the <sup>100</sup>Mo(n,Î³)<sup>101</sup>Mo reaction on natural molybdenum and subsequent beta-minus decay of <sup>101</sup>Mo to <sup>101</sup>Tc. Despite its shorter-half life (i.e., 14.22 min), <sup>101</sup>Tc exhibits unique decay characteristics suitable for radioisotope diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, where it has been proposed that its implementation, as a supplement for dual-isotopic imaging or replacement for <sup>99m</sup>Tc, could be performed by on-site production and dispensing at the point of patient care.
