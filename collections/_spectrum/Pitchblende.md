Uraninite, formerly pitchblende, is a radioactive, uranium-rich mineral and ore with a chemical composition that is largely UO<sub>2</sub> but because of oxidation typically contains variable proportions of U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Radioactive decay of the uranium causes the mineral to contain oxides of lead and trace amounts of helium. It may also contain thorium and rare-earth elements.
