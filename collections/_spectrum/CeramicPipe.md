Parts of a ceramic drainage pipe from a house from the 1820s (roughly). Clearly shows traces of uranium and thorium, which would be used in the glaze. Somewhat similar to the uranium glaze spectrum, but an earlier version without filtering out all the other nuclides except for the uranium -- therefore likely used raw Pitchblende (compare spectrum).
