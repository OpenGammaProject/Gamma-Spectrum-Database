Naturally occurring erbium (<sub>68</sub>Er) is composed of 6 stable isotopes, with <sup>166</sup>Er being the most abundant (33.503% natural abundance). 39 radioisotopes have been characterized with between 74 and 112 neutrons, or 142 to 180 nucleons, with the most stable being <sup>169</sup>Er with a half-life of 9.4 days. It is used as a radiopharmaceutical. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 3.5 hours, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 4 minutes.
