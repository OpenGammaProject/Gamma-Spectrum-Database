Americium-241 is an isotope of americium. Like all isotopes of americium, it is radioactive, with a half-life of 432.2 years. <sup>241</sup>Am is the most common isotope of americium as well as the most prevalent isotope of americium in nuclear waste. It is commonly found in ionization type smoke detectors and is a potential fuel for long-lifetime radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs).
