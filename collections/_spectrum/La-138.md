Naturally occurring lanthanum (<sub>57</sub>La) is composed of one stable (<sup>139</sup>La) and one radioactive (<sup>138</sup>La) isotope, with the stable isotope, <sup>139</sup>La, being the most abundant (99.91% natural abundance). There are 38 radioisotopes that have been characterized, with the most stable being <sup>138</sup>La, with a half-life of 1.02Ã—10<sup>11</sup> years; <sup>137</sup>La, with a half-life of 60,000 years and <sup>140</sup>La, with a half-life of 1.6781 days. The remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than a day and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 1 minute.
