Made free and open-source by [NuclearPhoenix](https://nuclearphoenix.xyz) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/). All of the interactive plots have been created using [Gamma MCA](https://spectrum.nuclearphoenix.xyz), a free web-based spectrum analyzer app.

This site is part of the [Open Gamma Project](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject) to provide modern and open-source resources for accessible gamma-spectroscopy. Many thanks to all of the people that helped in creating this database and especially for providing all of the spetra data!

## Want to submit a spectrum or a new radioisotope?

Awesome! Please open an issue, discussion thread or pull request on [Github](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Gamma-Spectrum-Database) with your spectrum source file (CSV, XML, TKA, ...), the specific duration of the measurement and the detector setup. You can also write me an email if you don't want to do it via GitHub for any reason.
